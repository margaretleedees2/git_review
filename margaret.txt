hello world
this a review of stuff I really should know
once I've made a file, I say, 

git init
	git init creates the tracking .git file

git add
	adds the stuff to staging

git commit - m "comment"
	commits the add and creates the local Master

git branch name_of_branch
	creates a branch

git checkout name_of_branch
	checks out the branch


To push your stuff up to the remote repo:

Within github.com, create a repo with the name "new_repo"
Copy the SSH/HTTPS:

git remote add origin https://..../new_repo
git remove -v 
	checks that the remote has been created

git push origin master
